# AppMold Template

This project is a client/server template that provides a quick way to get running with simultaneous client/server development. Also has bash utils to clone other templates into `./client` and `./server`

## How to use
Populate the `client` and `server` folders (feel free to use the `clone.sh` bash script).Run `yarn install` and `yarn start` to run the client and server concurrently. You can look into the `package.json` for more npm scripts.
