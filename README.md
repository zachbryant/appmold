# Like Lego Starter

This project is a client/server template that supports React and provides a malleable server architecture. Client was not generated using `create-react-app`, rather it was written from scratch as a way for me to learn just wtf CRA is doing, and to make future projects easier to start. In my opinion CRA abstracts configuration away a little _too_ much. They don't make it easy to customize.

### Client Packages
